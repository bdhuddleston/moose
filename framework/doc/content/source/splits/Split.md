# Split

!syntax description /Preconditioning/Split

The `Split` class is used to create split-based preconditioners.
The field split based preconditioner is entirely set up by defining the relevant PETSc options.
This syntax offers shorthands for some of the parameters that may be passed to PETSc,
such as for splitting between variables, blocks or sidesets.
For more information, please refer to [FieldSplitPreconditioner.md].

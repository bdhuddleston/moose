## MOOSE Improvements

### Added ParsedConvergence

[/ParsedConvergence.md] was added, which allows the user to specify arbitrary
convergence and divergence criteria. The parsed expression may include other
[Convergence](Convergence/index.md) objects, [Functions](Functions/index.md),
[Post-processors](Postprocessors/index.md), and constant values.

### General meshing

The [CutMeshByLevelSetGenerator.md] mesh generator was added to be able to modify meshes using general functions,
while keeping the cut mesh with a smooth first order surface. Previously, only plane cuts were supported.

### Restart capabilities

The [SolutionUserObject.md] can now use a fixed transformation on the time that it reads the solution at. This can be
used to load a new solution on every time step, but at a different rate than the simulation time.

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Thermal hydraulics

A new closure was added that leverages functors to compute the friction coefficients in flow components,
the wall heat transfer coefficient, and other thermal hydraulics closures.

### Fluid properties

In preparation for using the enthalpy variable in lieu of the temperature variable in computational fluid dynamics solves,
the `T_from_p_h` routine, used to compute temperature from the fluid pressure and enthalpy, was implemented in the following
fluid properties:

- HelmholtzFluidProperties, such as [CO2FluidProperties.md], [NitrogenFluidProperties.md], [MethaneFluidProperties.md] and [HydrogenFluidProperties.md]
- [LeadFluidProperties.md]
- [LeadBismuthFluidProperties.md]
- [StiffenedGasFluidProperties.md]

[TabulatedFluidProperties.md] were improved with the following modifications:

- a logarithmic grid in enthalpy can now be used for properties computed from specific volume and specific enthalpy
- a specific volume, specific energy tabulation can be read, but still rely on specific volume, specific enthalpy conversions to a pressure and temperature variable sets
  in order to avoid an iterative solve
- the number of out-of-bounds evaluations can now be tallied and reported in the console log

### Navier Stokes

The [VolumetricFlowRate.md] was extended to support the finite volume discretization.

An option to compute enthalpy directly rather than its approximation by the product of specific heat by temperature
has been added in the [INSFVEnthalpyFunctorMaterial.md]. This facilitates the problem setup when the approximation is not
valid, such as for compressible gases.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- MooseDocs SQA has the ability to check against multiple test specification file names (for example,
  `tests` as well as `assessments`) when performing requirement reporting and checks, using the
  `specs:` parameter in `sqa_reports.yml`.
- The [ElementMaterialSampler.md] can now be used to sample only selected material properties rather than all properties
  from a single `Material`. This can also be used to sample from properties defined by separate `Materials`.
- A check was added to prevent infinite recursion when using the same input file as part both the parent and
  child application.
- A new error was added when a user tries to initialize a variable using an Exodus initial condition and a shorthand `initial_condition`
  parameter in the relevant `Variable`'s block.
- A boolean flag was added to the `Outputs` block to limit the verbosity of the material property output, which is useful for large dimensional
  tensor property output
- The [ParsedGenerateNodeset.md] mesh generator can now work with non-contiguously numbered meshes
- A debug option was added for [Controls](syntax/Controls/index.md): `show_controllable` will output all the quantities that can be controllable
  at initialization, and all the controlled quantities and their current values during the simulation

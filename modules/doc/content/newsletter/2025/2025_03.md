The inaugural MOOSE International Workshop was held at the INL Meeting Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho
on March 10-13, 2025, and the theme of this year's meeting was "Multiphysics for Energy & Environmental
Applications". Technical tracks covered a wide range of applications and development in MOOSE, including
MOOSE for Nuclear Energy, Fusion, Geosystems, Renewable Energy, MOOSE framework and framework development,
and MOOSE physics modules. There were 169 registered attendees (see [full]), representing stakeholders
across the MOOSE community:

- 70 attendees from five (5) United States (U.S.) National Laboratories
- 2 attendees from two (2) U.S. Government agencies (Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of
  Energy)
- 49 attendees from 23 U.S. universities
- 15 attendees from 7 U.S. industry partners
- 14 attendees from two (2) foreign government organizations (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
  and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia)
- 4 attendees from two (2) foreign industry partners
- 15 attendees from seven (7) foreign universities

The event was a resounding success, allowing attendees to share research successes, learn new skills,
and develop ideas for future MOOSE development.

On behalf of the MOOSE development team ([team]), a big "Thank You" to our community for their continued
support of MOOSE and MOOSE-based simulation tools!

## MOOSE Improvements

### New SolutionInvalidity Summary Output

Introduced a new transient summary table to the SolutionInvalidity capability. Users now have access to the time history of the solution invalidity object at the end of the simulation if they use `flagSolutionWarning` to mark invalid solutions. It also supports customization of the time interval by creating a sub-block in `[Outputs]` and changing the [!param](/Outputs/SolutionInvalidityOutput/solution_invalidity_timestep_interval). Additionally, users can disable the summary table by adding `solution_invalidity_history = false` in `[Outputs]`.

```
Solution Invalid Warnings History:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                   Object                    | Time | Stepinterval Count | Total Count |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| NonsafeMaterial : Solution invalid warning! | 0-1  |                  0 |           0 |
| NonsafeMaterial : Solution invalid warning! | 1-2  |                 48 |          48 |
| NonsafeMaterial : Solution invalid warning! | 2-3  |                 48 |          96 |

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.03.06` Update

- Quadrature API changes.  A few virtual `QBase` methods have had
  changed signatures, and some methods have been deprecated in favor
  of newer versions, requiring `Elem` inputs rather than mere
  `ElemType` inputs, to enable support for elements like arbitrary
  polygons and polyhedra where a single class can take on different
  topologies at run time.
- `FE` and `FEInterface` API changes.  Some methods have been
  deprecated in favor of newer versions, either in `Elem` or taking an
  `Elem` rather than an `ElemType` argument, also for runtime-topology
  compatibility.
- Add APIs to control `System` name prefixing from C++, not just from
  the command line.  This will enable fixes for a MOOSE bug with
  independent preconditioning of multiple nonlinear systems, affecting
  the optimization module.
- Added an `integrate_slits` option to `JumpErrorEstimator`-based
  estimators
- Added an `OverlapCoupling` ghosting functor, useful for integrating
  on slit meshes or between manifolds of overlapping meshes.
- Bug fix: `DistributedMesh::add_point` now operates correctly when
  given a node id that was recently deleted from the mesh but has not
  yet been cleaned from the internal node container.
- Bug fix: `Prism6::build_side_ptr()` now sets `subdomain_id()`; this
  fixes a failure in adaptive mesh refinement of Prism6 elements with
  subdomain-restricted variables.
- Bug fix: methods which elevated mesh element order no longer
  renumber nodes and elements while doing so.  This fixes potential
  iterator invalidations in some use cases, and it's more efficient.
- Bug fix: when copying nodes and elements from a source mesh into a
  target `DistributedMesh` that is too small to use all its processors,
  the target mesh was left in an invalid state.  This fixes errors
  triggered by certain mesh stitching operations.
- Bug fix for range estimation bug in FParser optimizer
- Minor FE code refactoring for more simplicity and readability
- Minor optimization to some hash (and thus `unordered_map`) use cases
- Cleaned up and commented code with high-precision floating-point
  constants

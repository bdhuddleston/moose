## MOOSE Improvements

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.03.06` Update

- Quadrature API changes.  A few virtual `QBase` methods have had
  changed signatures, and some methods have been deprecated in favor
  of newer versions, requiring `Elem` inputs rather than mere
  `ElemType` inputs, to enable support for elements like arbitrary
  polygons and polyhedra where a single class can take on different
  topologies at run time.
- `FE` and `FEInterface` API changes.  Some methods have been
  deprecated in favor of newer versions, either in `Elem` or taking an
  `Elem` rather than an `ElemType` argument, also for runtime-topology
  compatibility.
- Add APIs to control `System` name prefixing from C++, not just from
  the command line.  This will enable fixes for a MOOSE bug with
  independent preconditioning of multiple nonlinear systems, affecting
  the optimization module.
- Added an `integrate_slits` option to `JumpErrorEstimator`-based
  estimators
- Added an `OverlapCoupling` ghosting functor, useful for integrating
  on slit meshes or between manifolds of overlapping meshes.
- Bug fix: `DistributedMesh::add_point` now operates correctly when
  given a node id that was recently deleted from the mesh but has not
  yet been cleaned from the internal node container.
- Bug fix: `Prism6::build_side_ptr()` now sets `subdomain_id()`; this
  fixes a failure in adaptive mesh refinement of Prism6 elements with
  subdomain-restricted variables.
- Bug fix: methods which elevated mesh element order no longer
  renumber nodes and elements while doing so.  This fixes potential
  iterator invalidations in some use cases, and it's more efficient.
- Bug fix: when copying nodes and elements from a source mesh into a
  target `DistributedMesh` that is too small to use all its processors,
  the target mesh was left in an invalid state.  This fixes errors
  triggered by certain mesh stitching operations.
- Bug fix for range estimation bug in FParser optimizer
- Minor FE code refactoring for more simplicity and readability
- Minor optimization to some hash (and thus `unordered_map`) use cases
- Cleaned up and commented code with high-precision floating-point
  constants

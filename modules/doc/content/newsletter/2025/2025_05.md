### `2025.05.23` Update

- Added a `System::parameters` object, which can be used to
  selectively override `EquationSystems::parameters`
- Improved support for vector-valued elements on meshes with 2D
  elements outside the XY plane in 3D space
- Initial support for `Polyhedron` type elements, with one basic
  subclass and hand-coded unit tests.  Critical support for mesh
  generation and I/O is still forthcoming.
- The `Elem::set_node()` setter which returns a reference has been
  deprecated and replaced by a version which takes the value to set.
  This provides compatibility with new Polyhedron support.
- Added `Elem::type_to_dim_map` and `Elem::type_to_default_order_map`,
  enabling code to query the dimension and/or default order of an
  `ElemType` without actually building an element.
- Added `NumericVector::print_matlab()` and
  `NumericVector::read_matlab()` I/O methods
- `MeshBase::write()` is now a `const` member
- `Elem::disconnected_clone()` can now clone elements which have not
  yet been given a valid `unique_id()`.
- Autodetection of slate use in PETSc, to initialize MPI with the
  `MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE` setting for slate compatibility.
- `solid_angle()` function for evaluating the solid angle defined by
  three vectors
- Code refactoring for clarity and simplicity:

  - Orientation-determining code for advanced finite element types
  - `Tet::choose_diagonal()` for tetrahedron refinement
  - More local variables declared `const` as appropriate
  - Unit tests are easier to make compatible with `--enable-complex`
    builds

- Removed workaround for overzealous gcc 8.1 warnings about gzstream
  headers; newer compilers including gcc 8.5 do not emit warnings.
- Avoid poor triangulator behavior when given an inconsistent boundary
  input mesh
- Performance logging of `n_connected_components()` mesh tool
- Many bug fixes:

  - More rigorous implementation and verification of
    `MeshBase::clone()`.  This fixes issues that can arise when
    certain `MOOSE` mesh generators accept input meshes which are
    incompletely prepared and have been cloned for use in multiple mesh
    generators.
  - `UnstructuredMesh::copy_nodes_and_elements()` no longer copies
    other metadata such as preparation policy settings from its source
    mesh.  That copying has been moved to copy constructors which need
    it, and no longer occurs during mesh stitching.  This fixes
    partitioning failures in a reactor module mesh generator.
  - `UnstructuredMesh::copy_nodes_and_elements()` is more careful
    about marking its target as unprepared if any combination of
    inputs might cause it to be unprepared
  - Fix for automatic interior-parents detection on refined meshes
  - Backported NetCDF fix for compatibility with C23 C compilers
  - Fixes for compiler `-fsanitize-integer` warnings
  - Many fixes for libMesh builds with `Real` defined to be other than
    `double`.  Many more libMesh capabilities such as higher-order
    quadrature rules are no longer truncated to 64-bit or 80-bit
    accuracy when used with 128-bit-`Real` builds.

# MOOSE Newsletter (December 2024)

!alert! note title=INL Holiday Curtailment
[!ac](INL) was closed for its annual Curtailment of Operations December 25, 2024 through January 1, 2025.
Accordingly, development of MOOSE and developer/user support was very light during this period. The
MOOSE development team hopes that all of our collaborators, users, and colleagues around the world
had a safe and restful holiday season!
!alert-end!

## MOOSE Improvements

### New Chain Controls

Several [ChainControls](syntax/ChainControls/index.md) were added:

- [LimitChainControl.md]
- [PIDChainControl.md]
- [RealToBoolChainControl.md]
- [ScaleOldChainControl.md]
- [SmootherChainControl.md]
- [TerminateChainControl.md]
- [UnitTripChainControl.md]

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Navier Stokes module

A new [Physics for the scalar transport equation using the linear finite volume discretization](WCNSLinearFVScalarTransportPhysics.md)
was added to the module. It is currently restricted to steady state problems. The [SIMPLE.md] executioner has been modified
to solve passive scalars after the pressure-velocity coupling has converged.

## libMesh-level Changes

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- Auxiliary and linear finite volume variables can now be retrieved through the `getFunctor<Real>` calls as `Real-`valued
  functors, even though they inherit from the MooseVariable which is an ADReal-valued functor. Since these two variable
  types do not actually leverage AD, this facilitates setting up non-AD functor materials.

## Conda Package Changes

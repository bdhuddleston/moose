# MOOSE Newsletter (December 2024)

!alert! note title=INL Holiday Curtailment
[!ac](INL) was closed for its annual Curtailment of Operations December 25, 2024 through January 1, 2025.
Accordingly, development of MOOSE and developer/user support was very light during this period. The
MOOSE development team hopes that all of our collaborators, users, and colleagues around the world
had a safe and restful holiday season!

# WallTemperature1PhaseClosures

This class is used to provide the wall temperature material property for
single-phase flow channels, depending on how many heat transfers are connected.
Note that this only activates if there is at least one heat transfer of
"temperature type" (i.e., not a specified heat flux) connected to the channel.
